# Family Tree Python Project

## Introduction

This Python project implements a basic family tree data structure that allows users to represent family relationships, query information about all family members as long as data is available, and save the family to a .csv or .json file. Due to the way it is implemented, it is recommended to use a .csv file. This file format takes up less space. However, it requires some conversion, which may result in longer run times.

## Features

- Simple and extensible tree data structure.
- Addition of nodes to represent family members.
- Addition of n given generations.
- Search nodes by ID
- Retrieval of family information.
- Saving and loading family information in a .csv or .json file.

   - git or GitHub Desktop
   - VS Code
